## WebCrawler and NLP System

This project attempts to broaden knowledge around horse health, by investigating the open question of whether the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques provides any insights or opportunities for further study. The solution proposed consisted of two major parts:

1. WebCrawler: for extracting horse health issues from internet forum posts.
    * Source: https://www.horseforum.com/forums/horse-health.17/
2. NLP system: two NLP tasks were performed:
    a. Topic modelling: to identify or group main areas of horse health issues.
    b. Sentiment analysis: to identify whether severity of condition or outcome could be determined for each topic modelled.
